Look up, I look up at night Planets are moving at the speed of light Climb up, up in the trees Every chance that you get is a chance you seize How long am I gonna stand With my head stuck under the sand? I'll start before I can stop Before I see things the right way up All that noise, and all that sound All those places that I have found And birds go flying at the speed of sound To show you how it all began Birds came flying from the underground If you could see it then you'd understand  Ideas that you'll never find Or the inventors could never design The buildings that you put up Japan and China all lit up The sign that I couldn't read Or the light that I couldn't see Some things you have to believe But others are puzzles, puzzling me All that noise, and all that sound All those places I got foundAnd birds go flying at the speed of sound To show you how it all began Birds came flying from the underground If you could see it then you'd understand Oh when you see it then you'll understand  All those signs, I knew what they meant Some things you can't invent Some get made, and some get sent Ooh?
