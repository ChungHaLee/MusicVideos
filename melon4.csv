stealingLike anyone has a fuckingability to even stick to a subjectIt's killing methe inability to pin humilityWhy don't we make a bunchof fuckin songs about nuthinAnd mumble oh fuck itI'm goin' for the jugularShit is a circusYou clowns that are comin updon't give an ounce of motherfuck about the ones that werehere before you to make rapsLet's recapWay back MC's thatRecap and take DexEight DATs

Ed Sheeran,Drunk,2011.09.09,포크,"I wanna be drunk when I wake upOn the right side of the wrong bedAnd never an excuse I made upTell you the truth I hateWhat didn't kill meIt never made me stronger at allLove will scar your make up, lip sticks to meSo now I maybe lean back thereI'm sat here wishing I was soberI know I'll never hold you like I used toBut a house gets cold when you cut the heatingWithout you to hold I'll be freezingCan't rely on my heart to beat in'Cause you take parts of it every eveningTake words out of my mouth just from breathingReplace with phrases like when you're leaving meShould I, should IMaybe I'll get drunk againI'll be drunk againI'll be drunk againTo feel a little loveI wanna hold your heart in both handsNot watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke canAnd I got no plans for the weekendSo should we speak thenKeep it between friendsThough I know you'll never love me like you used toThere may be other people like usWho see the flicker of the clipper when they light upFlames just create us but burns don't heal like beforeAnd you don't hold me anymoreOn cold days cold plays out like the band's nameI know I can't heal things with a hand shakeYou know I can't change as I began sayingYou cut me wide open like landscapeOpen bottles of beer but never champagneTo applaud you with the sound that my hands makeShould I, should IMaybe I'll get drunk againI'll be drunk againI'll be drunk againTo feel a little loveAll by myselfI'm here againAll by myselfYou know I'll never changeAll by myselfAll by myselfI'm just drunk againI'll be drunk againI'll be drunk againTo feel a little love
